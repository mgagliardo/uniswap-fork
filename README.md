# Homework 14

## How to run this.

1. Clone the repo
2. Install the packages:
```
$ npm install
```
3. Run the hardhat node:
```
$ npx hardhat node
```
4. Run scripts (deploy contracts).
```
npx hardhat run scripts/script.js 
```
5. Run tests
```
npx hardhat test --network hardhat
```

## TODO:
* Deploy rest of the contracts (WIP)
* Frontend
* Run with forked ganache node (`npx ganache-cli --fork ..`)
* Maybe deploy to the AVAX chain? :) 

## Disclaimer:

All of the smart contracts were extracted from the official [UniswapV2 Core](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core) and [UniswapV2 Periphery](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-periphery) repositories.
